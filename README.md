My Mission

- I've now embarked on my next chapter: building my own one-person company. This path grants me the freedom to work remotely and be the master of my own time.
- I'm passionate about creating products that solve real problems, especially tools that can improve someone's workflow, even if it's just by 0.00001%.
- Through my writing, I aim to document this journey and share my learnings, hoping to help others who might walk a similar path.
